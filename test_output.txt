[INFO] Система навчання готова до роботи!
[INFO] При створенні нових тікетів система автоматично:
  1. Аналізує ключові слова з тікету
  2. Порівнює з профілями експертизи спеціалістів
  3. Враховує поточне навантаження (активні тікети)
  4. Призначає найбільш досвідченого та доступного спеціаліста
